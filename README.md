# Birthday Coincidence Simulator

This is a dead simple JS to simulate the probability of two or more people in a classroom (up to 60 by default) having the same birthday. Please note that it generates a PNG image using an external service [QuickChart](https://quickchart.io).

## Usage

```
$ npm start
```

The result image will be saved in the project root.

## BTW

This was my first time using ChatGPT to generate this readme. Though I ended up having to re-edit most of the text above, I found it productive to let AI generate the draft. It was psychologically less taxing.
